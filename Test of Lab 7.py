#We need to start with prompting of the message screen starting with the print command
print('Good morning. What is your name?')

#It asks for our name next so we can define name using an input command
name = input()

#We now need to output a personalized greeting message
#We can do that with a print statement keeping in mind that a comma seperates things

#Example statement: print(' Have a nice day', name(our defined function from before, 'How are you today?')

#print('Have a nice day', name, 'How are you today?')


#We see that it works so lets try it out in the statement

print('Hello',name, ',','How are you today?')
